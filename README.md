# EUP2UB
Python script to convert EUP wardrobes to Ulitimate Backup XML peds. This is for the LSPDFR mod for GTAV.

You have two options to run this program. *Option 2 is easier.*
1. Take the .py script and run it yourself
2. Copy the EUP2UB.exe (found in \v0.1.0 of this repo) and place it in the 'Grand Theft Auto V\plugins\EUP' folder and double click. You should then see a file called 'UB_ped_xml.txt'. Copy the xml line you want into the appropriate UltimateBackup xml file. Read the UB docs for more info. 

Detailed tutorial coming soon.

You can find the latest release on the right under 'Releases'

I am a beginner dev, I will be making this program more Pythonic as time allows.
